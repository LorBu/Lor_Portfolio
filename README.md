*This portfolio is always growing, so keep coming back to see what's new.* üöÄüìä

## [Project 1: Loan Repayment Prediction using Neural Networks üí∏](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Neural%20Networks/Loan%20Repayment_ANN)

* **Objective**: The project aims to assess whether borrowers will repay their loans by analyzing key features such as loan amount, term, interest rate, and employment details.

* **Data**: The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains a rich array of features including income, loan purpose, and borrower demographics.

* **Approach**:   
  * Meticulous data exploration and preprocessing.
  * Handling missing values using appropriate methods.
  * Converting categorical features into numerical using one-hot encoding.
  * Normalizing numerical features to enhance model performance.

* **Insights**: The model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 89% in predicting loan repayment. Key features influencing repayment include loan grade, zip code, and debt-to-income ratio. These insights can inform lending practices and risk management strategies for improved decision-making.


## [Project 2: Yelp Reviews - NLP Project üí¨](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Yelp%20Reviews%20-%20NLP%20Project)

* **Objective**: Develop a classification model to accurately predict the rating corresponding to Yelp reviews.

* **Data**: Utilize the Yelp review dataset containing textual content, star ratings, and engagement metrics such as 'cool', 'useful', and 'funny' votes.

* **Approach**:
  * Conduct data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
  * Analyze the relationship between review length and star ratings.
  * Extract features from text data using CountVectorizer.
  * Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for rating prediction.

* **Subset Analysis**: Focus on extreme ratings (1-star and 5-star) for further evaluation of model performance within this subset.

* **TF-IDF Transformation**: Incorporate TF-IDF into the classification pipeline to weigh the importance of words and potentially improve feature representation.

* **Insight**: The model's performance varies significantly between extreme ratings, with higher accuracy in predicting extreme sentiments compared to ratings in between. This highlights the importance of fine-tuning the model for specific sentiment categories.



## [Project 3: 3D Image - Surface Generation üó∫Ô∏è](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/3D%20Image%20-%20Surface%20Generation)

* **Objective**: Generates a 3D surface plot from a series of images with varying focus to visualize the surface profile of an object.

* **Features**:
    * Utilizes OpenCV and NumPy for image processing.
    * Computes the standard deviation of pixel intensities within small regions across all images to create a 3D map.
    * Utilizes Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities for visualization.
    * Offers an option to apply a Butterworth filter to the images for frequency domain processing.


## [Project 4: Ecommerce Analysis üì±üåê](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression%20Project)

* **Objective:** Analyzes data from an Ecommerce company to determine focus on mobile app or website improvement.
* **Approach:**
  * Utilizes pandas for data loading and manipulation.
  * Employs seaborn for visualizing relationships between variables.
  * Applies scikit-learn's Linear Regression model for prediction.
  * Evaluates model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
* **Insights:**
  * Provides insights into customer behavior and preferences.
  * Recommends strategic decisions based on model analysis.


## [Project 5: Ads Engagement -Logistic Regrettion üñ±Ô∏è](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression%20Project)

* **Objective:** Aims to predict ad engagement using a fabricated advertising dataset and develop a logistic regression model for accurate forecasting.

* **Approach:**
  * Employs pandas for data exploration and examination.
  * Leverage seaborn to create visualizations depicting correlations among variables
  * Implements scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model for prediction.
  * Divides data into training and testing sets and trains the model on 70% of the data.

* **Insights:**
  * Evaluates model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  * Analyzes model coefficients to discern feature importance.
  * Concludes that internet usage, age, and time spent on the site are pivotal factors influencing ad clicking behavior.


## [Project 6: Iris Flower Data Set - SVM üå∫](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Support%20Vector%20Machines)

* **Objective:** Apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) on Fisher's Iris dataset to classify Iris species based on their characteristics.
