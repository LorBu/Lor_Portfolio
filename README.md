### Welcome to my ever-evolving Data Science Portfolio!

*Come on in and explore a world where data tells stories. Check out my projects showcasing my knack for digging deep into data, predicting trends, and uncovering insights. From figuring out what people are really saying to forecasting sales, I'm all about using Python, ML and cool visualization tools to make sense of it all.*

*This portfolio is always growing, so keep coming back to see what's new.* ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

## [Project 1: 3D Image - Surface Generation ](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/3D%20Image%20-%20Surface%20Generation)

* **Objective**: Generates a 3D surface plot from a series of images with varying focus to visualize the surface profile of an object.

* **Features**:
    * Utilizes OpenCV and NumPy for image processing.
    * Computes the standard deviation of pixel intensities within small regions across all images to create a 3D map.
    * Utilizes Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities for visualization.
    * Offers an option to apply a Butterworth filter to the images for frequency domain processing.


## [Project 2: Ecommerce Analysis](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression%20Project)

* **Objective:** Analyzes data from an Ecommerce company to determine focus on mobile app or website improvement.
* **Approach:**
  * Utilizes pandas for data loading and manipulation.
  * Employs seaborn for visualizing relationships between variables.
  * Applies scikit-learn's Linear Regression model for prediction.
  * Evaluates model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
* **Insights:**
  * Provides insights into customer behavior and preferences.
  * Recommends strategic decisions based on model analysis.


## [Project 3: Ads Engagement -Logistic Regrettion](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression%20Project)

* **Objective:** Aims to predict ad engagement using a fabricated advertising dataset and develop a logistic regression model for accurate forecasting.

* **Approach:**
  * Employs pandas for data exploration and examination.
  * Leverage seaborn to create visualizations depicting correlations among variables
  * Implements scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model for prediction.
  * Divides data into training and testing sets and trains the model on 70% of the data.

* **Insights:**
  * Evaluates model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  * Analyzes model coefficients to discern feature importance.
  * Concludes that internet usage, age, and time spent on the site are pivotal factors influencing ad clicking behavior.


## [Project 4: Iris Flower Data Set - SVM](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Support%20Vector%20Machines)

* **Objective:** Apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) on Fisher's Iris dataset to classify Iris species based on their characteristics.
  
* **Features:**
  * Data exploration and visualization using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  * Implementation of SVM for classification using the scikit-learn library.
  * Model evaluation and performance analysis through confusion matrices and classification reports.
  * Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the SVM model.

## [Project 5: Liquor Sales Analysis](https://github.com/LorBu/Lor_Portfolio/tree/main/Liquor%20Sales%20Analysis)

* **Objective:** Analyze liquor sales data from Iowa, USA (2012-2020) to identify popular products.

* **Data Preparation:**
  * Utilizes Pandas for data cleaning and preparation.
  * Prepares the dataset by addressing missing values through removal, duplicate elimination, and imputation for any remaining gaps..

* **Tasks:**
  * Identifies top-selling item per zip code.
  * Computes sales percentage per store (2016-2019).

* **Insights:**
  * Provides valuable insights for inventory management and marketing strategies.
  * Helps in understanding consumer preferences and market dynamics.
