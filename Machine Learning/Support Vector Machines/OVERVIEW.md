# Iris Flower Data Set - Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project

## Introduction
This project explores the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) on Fisher's Iris data set, a classic example in the realm of discriminant analysis. The goal is to classify Iris species based on their characteristics using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The project includes the following key components:
* Data exploration and visualization using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification using the scikit-learn library.
* Model evaluation and performance analysis through confusion matrices and classification reports.
* Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the SVM model.

## Files
* 'Iris_SVM_Classification_Project.ipynb': Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the project, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and parameter tuning.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project serves as a demonstration of SVM's effectiveness in classifying Iris species based on their characteristics. It showcases the application of machine learning techniques for classification tasks and highlights the importance of parameter tuning and model optimization in achieving optimal performance.
