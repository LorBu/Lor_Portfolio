Project Overview
This project aims to generate a three-dimensional (3D) image from a series of photographs capturing the testing material with slight variations in focus, typically ranging from 20 to 50 micrometers. The primary focus of this project is on image processing using Python programming to adjust the images and produce a final 3D plot illustrating the numerical dimensions of the 3D image plane.

Optical Engineering Aspect
The initial phase of the project involves optical engineering tasks, which are essential for capturing the series of photos with varying focus. This aspect is considered beyond the scope of this project and is assumed to have been addressed separately.

Image Processing Workflow
The core of the project revolves around leveraging Python programming for image processing tasks. The workflow typically includes adjustments and enhancements applied to the captured images to optimize their quality and prepare them for the 3D reconstruction process.

Final Output
The ultimate goal is to generate a comprehensive 3D plot that accurately represents the dimensions and structure of the testing material. This plot serves as a visual aid for analyzing the material's properties and gaining insights into its spatial characteristics.
