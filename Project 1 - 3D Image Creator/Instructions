The task of this project is to create a 3D image from a bunch of photos taken with slightly different focus on the testing material (20-50 micrometers). 

The first step regarding the optical engineering is beyond the topic of this project.

As for the image processing, we use programming in Python to make adjustments on the images and create the final 3D plot in which we see numerically the dimensions of the 3D image plane.
